# Getting-Far-Bot

A Geometry Dash tool used on Discord for having a Bot deafen the user when they 'get far' on a level at a specified percentage. 
Until I figure out how to package this script into a single file, this has to be installed the hard way.

## Installation

This requires installing Python 3.7 or higher.
You will also need to install additional modules for the script:
- `discord` is needed to run a Discord Bot.
- `pynacl` is a dependency for the `discord` module and used for voice.
- `asyncio` provides asyncronous task-related commands.
- `gd` is the main Python wrapper for Geometry Dash interaction.
To install a module, in a **Command Prompt** type:
```
python -m install module_name
```
The exception to this is the `gd` module, which is installed in a
slightly different way to get the latest updated version:
```
python -m pip install --upgrade https://github.com/NeKitDS/gd.py/archive/master.zip
```

## Setup

You need to create a **Discord Bot** to have something to deafen you when you get far in a Geometry Dash level.
My video on [Getting Far Bot 1.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlWmOtQ80PM) includes a visual guide on creating a Discord Bot, or
[this doc](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html) also works. These show how to create a Bot and get its essential **Bot Secret**.
Once you have the Bot Secret, open `secret.txt` and add it next to `BOT_SECRET=`.
In addition, the Bot will only respond to commands if:
1) The Discord account who created the Bot made the command
2) The Bot has a role with the `Administrator` permission

There are also additional setting configurations in `settings.txt`:
- `GETTING_FAR`: What % the bot will Server Deafen you at
- `TIMEOUT`: How long the program will wait during a Pause for a response (10 = 1s)
- `BOT_PREFIX`: Chars before the command name the bot will respond to
- `FAR_CHANNEL`: (Optional) Discord Channel ID to announce deaths past GETTING_FAR. (Bot will handle this)

## Usage

Once you have installed Python with its required modules, and set up a Discord Bot and linked it to `secret.txt`,
to run the program:
1) Open Geometry Dash
2) Run the script with:
```
python main.py
```
To turn off the Bot, simply close the script's window.

### Commands

- `join_call`: Joins the Voice Channel you are currently in. You must be in a Voice Channel to use this command.
- `far_channel`: Toggles the channel this command was typed in as a **Far Channel**. The Bot will send messages
to the channel when the user is getting far, has died past the far percentage, or has completed the level.
